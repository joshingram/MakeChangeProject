# Make Change Project

## Description
This program simulates a cash register at a point of sale.  It will:
 - Ask the user for a purchase price and the amount paid.
 - Determine if sufficient funds have been tendered and if change is due.
 - If change is due, calculate the number of each bill and coin to return.

## What I learned
I learned about Java methods (use of multiple methods, calling methods, and passing values to/from methods), ways to mitigate Java's double rounding errors, if/else if/else statements, using the Java Scanner to gather user input, and git and gitHub as a repository.

### Technologies used
Java, Eclipse, git/gitHub
